## Features

### Core
- **Adventure Mode World Type**: Available directly in the world creation screen. The default Adventure Mode option is set to *Adventurable World*.
- **Smooth Progression**: Ensures the player can always advance without getting stuck.

### World Generation
- **Guaranteed Entrances**: Strongholds, Trial Chambers, and other dungeons always have surface-level entrances.
- **Mob-based Resources**: Miner Zombies, Skeletons, Villagers, Piglins, and others provide ores or trades, reducing dependence on mining.
- **Vertical Structures**: Giant ladders and piston-worm style shafts connect surface caves to the Deep Dark.
- **Campfire Teleports**: Scattered campfires act as short-range teleport nodes, reducing backtracking.
- **Reachability Algorithm**: Every cave, mountain top, and floating island is guaranteed to be accessible through path generation, ladders, or parkour routes.
- **High-value Loot**: Hard-to-reach floating islands and hidden structures contain advanced rewards.

### Settlements
- **Functional Villages**: Every village contains essential functional blocks (e.g. anvil, brewing stand, enchanting table).
- **Outposts and Camps**: Hunter huts and miner camps with workbenches, furnaces, and teleport anchors.

### Special Rules
- **Block Acquisition Guarantee**: Every key block type has at least one obtainable path.
- **Farmland Protection**: Village crops are safeguarded from destruction (e.g. auto-regeneration or unbreakable farmland).
- **Special Structures**: Beacons, Conduits, and other multiblock structures may generate in simplified or ready-to-use forms.
- **Active Nether Portals**: The world spawns with at least one active Nether portal.

### Path System
A **Playability Layer** added on top of vanilla terrain:
- Ensures continuous paths to points of interest.
- Provides auxiliary facilities (ladders, bridges, teleport campfires) when natural terrain is too harsh.
- Supports both linear and branching progression routes.

### Mod Compatibility
- Designed to cooperate with other mods via APIs for loot tables, structures, and block acquisition.
